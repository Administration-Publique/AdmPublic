- **Market:** Anyone who needs a public service in Haiti, or even some information about it, can use this app.
- **Habit:** This application can be used as often or as often as the user wants, depending on the level at which his life is related to the public service and what they are looking for exactly. this application will of course be used, more frequently at certain periods for certain age categories. (as after the Bacc exams)
